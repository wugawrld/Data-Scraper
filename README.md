Python Data-Scraper! 

A fully functional data-scraper written in Python. scraper.py extracts Chief Keef's Top 500 Spotify song streams from Kworb.net and writes them as a CSV; csv_to_vs.py reads the csv and plots the Top 15 songs as a scatter plot.

This project demonstrates the use of BeautifulSoup, Requests, and CSV libraries within the scrapper.py file to receive, parse, and rite the acquired html data as a CSV. Furthermore, csv_to_vis.py showcases the use of Matplotlib.pyplot and Pandas libraries to read the created csv file and visualize this data as a scatter plot. 

This is my first project ever, enjoy!
